&lt;div align="center"&gt;12 December 1942&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While alongside U.S.S. MERCURY in Tulagi Harbor as part
of Task Force 62.4.3 at about 0400 Love received orders from
the U.S.S. DEHAVEN, to proceed in company, to west and northward
of Savo to search for a Japanese destroyer reported burning as a
result of a night encounter with out P T boats.  In clearing the
U.S.S. MERCURY, her cargo boom fouled the U.S.S. SAUFLEY starboard
yard arm and carried away all radio transmitting antennae except
the TBS.  While proceeding at thirty (30) knots received radio
report from planes that there were a number of Japanese landing
boats along the shore about two (2) miles west of Cape Esperance,
THE U.S.S. DEHAVEN detailed the U.S.S. SAUFLEY to investigate those
boats and continued to the northwestward to search for the
destroyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.S. SAUFLEY requested location of own PT boats from
Tulagi (via the U.S.S. DEHAVEN due to lack of transmitter),  Received
word that there were two (2) still out in the area.  After
accounting for those two (2), sighted other unidentified boats
underway offshore about two (2) miles west of Esperance.  Requested
U.S.S. DEHAVEN to again check location of our own PT boats and
stated that the USS SAUFLEY was going to open fire on boats
sighted.  Received no further information on own boats and opened
fire at about 12000 yards to prevent boats from reaching shore.
After five salvos received word that another U.S. PT boat had
reported being fired upon.  Ceased fire.  Did not observe any
direct hits on PT boats and believe no damage done.  Continued
cruising offshore in the vicinity.  Amplifying reports received
indicating that one previously unaccounted for PT boat was aground
and other PT boats were proceeding in to assist, taking off boat
or crew as feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the above period operations were seriously hampered
by fact that PT boats and planes were on the same frequency.
Testing and tuning of plane transmitters interfered with operational
orders and reports between PT boats, the U.S.S. DEHAVEN, U.S.S. SAUFLEY
and Tulagi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.S. DEHAVEN made no contact, and after receiving plane
report that no Japanese ships were in the vicinity returned to the
vicinity of Cape Esperance and directed the U.S.S. SAUFLEY report
to Commander Task Group 66.7.1 in U.S.S. MINNEAPOLIS, Captain
C.E. ROSENDAHL, Commanding, at Tulagi, for further instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returned, searched area west and south of Savo for survivors
of lost PT boat.  Found wreckage of PT boat which apparently
had caught fire and then blown up.  No survivors were found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;ACTION REPORT OF ATTACK ON JAPANESE SUBMARINE 8 July 1943&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  During the approach, after being directed to investigate,
the ship went to General Quarters and preparations
were made for torpedo, gun and depth charge attack.  Torpedoes
were left at basic depth setting of ten (10) feet and medium
speed.  Depth charges were set for a nine charge medium pattern
(two hundred (200) feet).  Main battery director was put on target
and commenced tracking immediately.  Control was directed to be
prepared to illuminate with star shells from one gun when fire was
opened.  Both SG and FD radars had good contacts.  Some uncertainty
arose as to the nature of the target however because of the low
speed and apparent erratic courses until about 0526.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  In addition, the FD radar reported two targets in
line and about one thousand (1000) yards apart.  The near target
disappeared from the FD screen, however, at about five thousand
(5000) yards and from then on both plot and CIC agreed on target
course and speed.  The early stages of the CIC plot resembled
that of a rain squall however.  This may have been due to inaccurate
ranges and bearings at the extreme ranges first obtained for
this type of target, or it may have been due to the submarine's
lying to, or possibly to the presence of two or more targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  When the range was about four thousand (4000) yards the
target was seen directly ahead and indistinctly in binoculars
from the bridge.  Since target speed was still low, the
decision was made to stand on before opening fire in case the
submarine was slow to diving and a ramming attack became possible.
The target quickly became more distinct, probably due to the beginning
of dawn, and at two thousand five hundred (2500) yards
was clearly visible.  At that time (0533) the target was seen
to be broadside on to us, still making very low speed, and high
out of the water.  It appeared similar to the I-1 class except
that no deck guns were observed.  His length was estimated as
about three hundred (300) feet.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>
&lt;p&gt;4.  At that time it was believed that the submarine
could not possibly fail to see us and therefore course was altered
about 40 to the right and Main Battery and Torpedo Party told to
stand by.  As soon as the after guns would bear orders were given
to fire 5” and also a salvo of three (3) torpedoes.  Then the
range had closed to about two thousand (2000) yards commenced
firing with 20 and 40mm machine guns.  Eight (8) salvos of 5"
were fired and seven (7) starshells.  The Commanding Officer gave
"Cease fire torpedo battery" after the Torpedo Officer ordered
“Fire three”.  The torpedoman on the ready switches was slow,
however, and the third torpedo did not get off on the Torpedo
Officer's command.  the the torpedoman heard the Commanding
Officer's "Cease fire" he failed to close his switch for the
third torpedo.  Right after that the submarine submerged at a
range of about twelve hundred (1200) yards, and about abeam.
Gunfire was ceased and the rudder was then put hard left in an
attempt to reach a position for dropping depth charges.  The close
range and shock of gunfire as well as the 5" splashes prevented
SG radar and CIC party from getting a clear radar plot and the
high speed prevented getting any sound plot.  After getting the
rudder over, however, the speed was reduced to eighteen (18) knots
and echo ranging begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  The 5" salvos were reported to straddle by the spotter
although several were observed short from the bridge.  It was
afterwards found the director pointer had been using his sight
on the horizon until fire was opened but that the splashes
prevented him from seeing clearly after that and it is believed
that his pointing was erratic.  Hereafter full reliance will be
placed on the stable element for night firing and laying by
telescope will not be attempted unless stable element fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  It is believed that the torpedoes probably missed
due to their shallow setting and the fact that the submarine
probably got beneath them just as they crossed the line.  All
other factors in the setup were rechecked immediately after
firing and no errors were found.  It is now believed that one tube
mount should be put on twenty-five (25) feed basic depth setting
and the other left on a shallow for future attacks of this type.
Ordinarily on runs "Up the slot" from Guadalcanal it is believed
that the most likely targets are destroyers and light transports
and accordingly shallow depth settings are required.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>
&lt;p&gt;7.  After echo ranging was begun the target was finally
picked up by sound gear on bearing 225 range one thousand (1000)
yards.  The ship was brought right to the attack course, continuing
the speed eighteen (18) knots.  On reaching that course it was
found that the submarine had reversed course to give us a stern
chase.  Range rate was about ten (10) knots.  The reversal of
submarine course made it difficult to set a lead angle but it is
believed that a correct approach was finally made because a large
boil was observed in the water about fifty (50) feet off the
starboard bow just before the depth charges were dropped.  The
firing was done from the recorder using a five (5) second extra
delay.  The depth charge pattern extended about one hundred (100)
yards beyond the "boil" along the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.  After returning for a second attack, speed was
reduced to fifteen (15) knots and contact was finally made at 0613 and
a new run begun.  In this case the echoes were weaker than
the first one and could not conclusively be said to be a submarine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.  An attack was made however, as shown on the track
chart and a second nine (9) charge pattern dropped.  One good echo was
obtained dead aft at five hundred (500) yards about one minute
after the last charge was dropped.  Thereafter no more contacts
could be obtained.  The area was searched for twelve (12) hours
by this ship as shown on the track chart.  At that time the
SAUFLEY was relieved by the U.S.S. PHILIP and search continued
for about seven (7) hours additional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.  In view of the fact that the USS PHILIP also had SG
Radar and made no contacts after dark it is believed that the
submarine was hit by the first depth charge pattern and sunk.
If it had been undamaged it is believed that it would have surfaced
after dark and attempted to escape.  In that case it is believed
that it would been picked up by the PHILIP's SG radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.  In future attacks of this sort a high speed
direct approach will be made.  If no unusual motion of target is
observed a pattern of three (3) torpedoes will be fired using
curved fire ahead and a twenty-five (25) foot depth setting with
magnetic exploder inoperative.  This permits a direct ramming
approach in case the submarine does not submerge in time.  It is
believed that gunfire is relatively ineffective at the longer
ranges of 5000 - 6000 yards and at short ranges the turn to bring
all guns to bear hampers a ramming approach.  In any event gunfire
gives a very positive warning of the destroyer's presence
and the submarine is sure to dive immediately if not hit on one
of the early salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>
&lt;p&gt;12.  In this case it is not believed that the Japanese
listening gear was very effective since no action was taken by
the submarine until a range of twenty-five hundred (2500) yards
Was reached and gunfire begun.  It should be noted that the SAUFLEY
did not echo range until after the submarine submerged.&lt;/p&gt;
