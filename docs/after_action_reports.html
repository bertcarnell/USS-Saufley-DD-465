                <div class="row">
                    <p>1.  The USS SAUFLEY in company with Task Unit 31.5.2
                    was engaged in covering the first echelon of LOIs landing at
                    BARAKONA, VELLA LAVELLA, in accordance with Commander Task Force
                    THIRTY-ONE'S Operation Order A12-43. The Task Unit arrived at
                    BARAKOMA at 0710, August 15, and LCIs commenced unloading. The
                    SAUFLEY proceeded to WILSON STRAIT to assume radar guard. Own
                    fighters were providing air coverage during operation. At 0753
                    bogies were picked up on SC radar coming in from northwest. At
                    0000 Japenese dive bombers dove on landing area and were taken
                    under fire by destroyers in landing area. Planes appeared aimiler
                    to Aichi 99's. Five inch antiaircraft fire appeared to be heavy
                    but dispersed. Own fighters followed dive bombers through anti-
                    aircraft fire.</p>
                    <p>2.  One dive bomber going low over southern tip of
                    VELLA LAVELLA was seen to go down in flames after a fighter dove
                    on it. Another was seen heading up WILSON STRAIT with 4 or 5
                    of our fighters diving on him. SAUFLEY did not fire as none of
                    the
                    Japanese planes needed for ship and fighters seemed to have the
                    situation well under control.</p>
                    <p>3.  At 0910 the LOIS completed unloading and the Task
                    Unit proceeded at 12 knots for GUADALGANAL, destroyers screening
                    ahead.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 2048, while southeast of VANGUNU ISLAND, the
                    SAUFLEY had an so radar contact bearing 300°(T), range 15 miles,
                    range decreasing rapidly. Contact was reported to Commander Task
                    Unit and ship went to full general quarters. SG radar picked up
                    the contact at 13000 yards indicating the planes were flying very
                    low. FD radar picked up planes at 7000 yards. SAUFLEY was screen-
                    ing on starboard bow of ICIs at this time.</p>
                    <p>5.  Two planes were aighted coming in satern of the
                    formation after passing over the PHILIP at sn altitude of about
                    150 feet. Fire of 5" battery was withheld because planes were
                    so low and own oh ips were between us and the target. One plane
                    banked sharply and passed about 100 yards estern of th is ship
                    flashing a signal light as if to challenge. The other plane con-
                    timed over the formation, decreasing altitude to about 50 feet
                    and was seen to drop 6 torpedo close to the WALLER. This plane
                    then circled to the right and passed abeara about 1000 yerds and
                    was taken under fire with the main battery. Dursts were low and
                    estern of the plane. The signal light of the first plano caused
                    some confusion as to whether or not the planes were friendly and
                    for this reason the 4Cmm did not open fire. The planes were
                    later identified as Mitsubishi type 97 as it was B clear moonlight
                    night with excellent visibility.</p>
                    <p>6.  On the second attack about 2103 a low flying plane
                    ploked up by the SG rader came in and passed about 300 yards satern
                    of the ship heading across the formation and was taken under fire
                    by SAUFLEY 4.cmm. As the plane crossed the formation the PHILIP
                    took the plane under fire with her 40mm and it was seen to disep-
                    pear in a streat of 40mm tracers followed by a dull red flash.</p>
                    <p>7.  On the third attack about 2108 a low flying plane
                    was picked up by SG rader on the port bow at a range of about 5000
                    yards and was taken under fire with the main battery.</p>
                    <p>8.  About 2000, before the attack developed, a snooper
                    plane had trailed the formation keeping at a range of about 10
                    miles. This together with the fact that the planes making the
                    attacks made steedy bearing approach from 15 miles seems to indi-
                    este the snooper was used to direct the attack.</p>
                    <p>9.  It is estimated that from four to six planes took
                    part in the attack although only two were seen at a time. Four
                    to five separate attacks were made, all from the northwest, the
                    destroyers being their main targets. A total of six underweter
                    explosions were heard and felt although no damage was done.</p>
                    <p>10.  The total ammunition expended on the three attacks
                    within gun range was 8 rounds antiaircraft common, 32 rounde Mark
                    32 projectiles and 12 rounds of 40mm with no observed hits.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">16 MARCH 1945</p>
        
                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>
        
                    <p>A.  The period covered by this report includes the sortie
                    from Zanboanga, Mindanao by t he Basilan Attack Unit to the landing
                    boach on Basilan Island on 16 March 1945.</p>
                    <p>B.  The USS SAUFLEY's participation in this operation
                    consisted of providing the prearranged initial bolbardment, and
                    action as the covering force for the other units involved while
                    being available for call-fire support.</p>
                    
                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>
                    
                    <p>A.  SAUFLEY was ordered to anchor in Santa Cruz Bank
                    the morning of 16 March and the commanding officer to report at
                    about 0700 to Commander Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT ONE POINT
                    TWO (Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO) for a conference
                    preliminary to the operation at hand. During the conference the
                    Officer in Tactical Command explained the details of the landing.
                    The USS SAUFLEY was underway at 0845 and joined Commander Task
                    Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT ONE POINT TWO in the USS WALLER, proceeding
                    to the objective area at maximum speed to meet the bombardment
                    schedule which was noved ahead twenty (20) minutes to make up for
                    lack of air bombardment.</p>
                    <p>B.  The SAUFLEY operated with the destroyor support unit
                    which consisted of the USS WALLER (F), USS ROBINSON and USS SAUFLEY
                    under the connand of Captain R. H. SMITH, Commander Destroyer
                    Squadron TWENTY TWO (Officer in Tactical Connand).</p>
                    <p>C.  SAUFLEY's targets for the initial prearranged bonbardment
                    prior to the landing were Lanitan Town and Luajon Hill on Basilan
                    Island.</p>
                    <p>D.  Own forces consisted of the destroyer support unit,
                    the LCS support unit, the control units, and the small landing
                    force. Motor Torpodo Boats were operating in the area but

                    <p>On November 27, 1944, the USS SAUFLEY in
                        company with Destroyer Division FORTY THREE consisting of the
                        USS WALLER (Captain R.H. Smith ComDesRon TWENTY TWO as OTC)
                        plus USS SAUFLEY, USS RENSHAW, and USS PRINGLE, in that order,
                        got underway at 1814(I) and stood out through Surigao Strait
                        for Ormoc Bay via a predetermined route at 30 knots, in
                        accordance with Commander Task Force SEVENTY SEVEN Destroyer
                        Operation Plan #7-44 and ComDesRon TWENTY TWO operation order
                        #1-44 of 26 November. The mission as assigned was to bombard
                        enemy installation in Ormoc Bay and to make a sweep through
                        the Camotes Sea for the purpose of destroying enemy shipping
                        which might be attempting to land reinforcements on the West
                        Coast of Leyte. Motor torpedo boats in the northern Camotes
                        Sea plus a PBY operating south and west of Ornoc Bay were
                        assigned for the purpose of keeping Destroyer Division FORTY
                        THREE informed of any enemy shipping approaching or in vicinity107z
                        of Ormoc Bay. Visibility was extremely poor with rain accom-
                        pained by variable winds until about 2330 at which time the
                        weather partially cleared with light and intermittent rain
                        squalls.</p>
                    <p>At 2329(I) the Division changed course to 355
                        true, reduced speed to 20 knots, and formed in line of bearing,
                        125° relative. All ships in the Division were scheduled to
                        fire on target Able. The SAUFLEY commenced firing at 2339 (I)
                        with the range 9050 yards and bearing 013.5 true and ceased
                        firing at 2346(I) at a range 7750 yards and bearing 0409 true.
                        Results were not observed due to poor visibility. No counter
                        battery fire was encountered. Ammunition expended, 120 rounds
                        AA Common.</p>
                    <p>Course was changed to 2600 true and at 2352 (I)
                        the SAUFLEY commenced firing on assigned target Easy, three
                        gun emplacements and supply dump, at a range of 16,250 yards,
                        bearing 351 true. Fired eight five gun salvos with results
                        unobserved. After turning south and making a new approach
                        SAUFLEY commenced firing at 0022 (I) on target Fox, enemy barge
                        hideout. Fired four five gun salvos at range 12,250 yards,
                        bearing 334 true. Another approach was made and three five
                        gun salvos were fired on same target at 0037 (I) at a range of
                        9050 yards, bearing 348° true, with results unobserved.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of bombardment mission the
                        Division made a sweep to westward in the Camotes Sea. A PBY
                        on patrol had reported an enemy submarine approaching Ormoc
                        Bay at 2315(I) in Latitude 10°-33' North, Longitude 124 -25'
                        East, on course 045 true, speed 12.0 knots. On returning to
                        Ormoc Bay the RENSHAW reported a surface target bearing 149
                        true at a range of 15,000 yards from her. At 0125 (I) the
                        SAUFLEY picked up same target at a range of 11,500 yards and
                        commenced coaching the main battery on the target. The
                        RENSHAW commenced firing first and the SAUFLEY second at
                        0132(I) at a range of 5,800 yards, bearing 142 true.</p>
                    <p>The submarine was undoubtedly surprised as
                        he was maneuvering radically with a speed of about six
                        knots. Starshell illumination was ordered and after good
                        illumination the main battery shifted to optical control at
                        a range of about 4000 yards as the radars were unable to
                        distinguish the target from the numerous splashes of all ships
                        firing at close ranges. The Division changed course to south
                        and it appeared that the USS WALLER was going to ram the sub-
                        marine. All ships commenced firing their 40MM guns. Numerous
                        hits were seen on the submarine but the submarine crew was
                        still firing back with their 3" and machine guns. The WALLER
                        did not ram but passed close aboard to starboard circling the
                        submarine. All ships ceased firing. Shortly after the WATLER
                        circled the submarine the Division Commander reported the
                        submarine sunk, stern first, and stopped to try to pick up
                        survivors. From the SAUFLEY we observed several survivors in the
                        water plus a small amount of unrecognizable debris. Ammunition
                        expended was 245 rounds AA Common, 6 Starshells and 60 rounds
                        40MM.</p>
                    <p>Communications were good except for occasional
                        rain static. The submarine reported by the PBY at 2315 (I) was
                        sunk by Destroyer Division FORTY THREE at about 0144(I) in
                        approximately Latitude 10°-48' N, Longitude 124° - 35'E. This
                        seems to be an exceptional feat of rapid communications in
                        addition to close coordination of all units concerned as only
                        2.5 hours elapsed between the reporting and sinking of the
                        submarine. Navigation was accomplished entirely by radar.
                        The bombardments were conducted by coaching the director on
                        target from navigational fixes and the dead reckoning tracer.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that, during the
                        firing on the submarine, spotting could have been effected by
                        means of the SG PPI, as definite indications of at least six
                        straddles were observed around the targets echo. Between the
                        times of firing at target Able and target Easy an echo appeared
                        on the SG radar, having previously been reported by the RENSHAW.
                        The SAUFLEY prepared to take this target under fire but upon
                        tracking found the radar ranges and bearings to be extremely
                        variable. No dead reckoning tracer or computer track could be
                        obtained and the target finally disappeared from all radar
                        screens. It is believed that this was a phantom radar target.</p>
                    <p>No casualties to personnel or material were
                        experienced and both performed in an excellent manner.

                    <p>1.  Forwarded.</p>
                    <p>2.  On the night of 27 - 28 November 1944 the subject
                        bombardment mission was marked by the successful attack upon an
                        enemy submarine by destroyers assigned to the mission.</p>
                    <p>3.  Contact with the submarine was made by one of our
                        patrol planes at 2315/I, in Latitude 10°-31'N, Longitude 124°-
                        25'E. The destroyers were directed to the target and after a
                        surface action sank the submarine at about 0144/I in Latitude
                        10°-48'N, Longitude 124°-35'E.</p>
                    <p>4.  This excellent cooperation between air and surface
                        units, which resulted in destruction of the enemy submarine
                        within two and one half hours after contact, is noted with approval.</p>
                    <p>5.  By copy of this endorsement Command er Task Force
                        Seventy-Three is requested to commend the pilot and crew of the
                        PBY which made this important contact.</p>

                    <p>1.  The SAUFLEY in company with Task Group 31.6 was
                        engaged in escorting and providing coverage to landing operations
                        at BARAKOMA, Vella Lavella from 16 - 19 August in accordance
                        with Commander Task Force THIRTY-ONE'S Operation Order A12-43.
                        Fighter director unit from GUADAICANAL was aboard during these
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>2.  Bogies were picked up at 1900 on the 16th while
                        the SAUFLYY in company with the WALLER and PHILIP was proceeding
                        to rendezvous with 1ST's off the RUSSEL ISLANDS. st 1910 con-
                        meneed firing 5" battery while off CAFE ESPERENCE, GUADALOANAL.
                        No results were observed. Contact considered doubtful. During
                        the night bogies were frequently reported but none came within
                        gun range.</p>
                    <p>3.  At 1850 on the 17th SC radar reported bogies 39
                        miles ecming in from west of VELLA LAVELLA. st this time LST's
                        were unloading on beach at BARAKOMA and destroyers were patrol-
                        ling off shore. st 1910 several bombs landed on beach near LST's
                        and LST's opened up with 20mm's. No results were observed. LST's
                        then got underway and the task group proceeded down GIZO STRAIT
                        at 9 knots, destroyers patrolling at 30 knots, laying smoke
                        screens to cover LST'S. At 2142 & plane cane in low over the
                        formation at high speed. Only the flames from his exhaust could
                        be seen and all ships opened up with 40 and 20mm's. The plane
                        seemed to be encompassed by tracers but he apparently WELB not
                        badly damaged. At 2144 commenced firing 5" and 40mm's at plane
                        flying low down our port side at a range of about 1000 yards or
                        less. Again no results were observed and only his exhaust could
                        be seen. At 2245 the WALLER and PHILIP had collision. At 2347
                        stopped smoke. During the above period there were bogies on the
                        screen almost continuously. Only the ones which made close
                        approaches have been listed.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 2345 the SAUFLEY and PHILIP left Task Group
                        THIRTY-ONE POINT STX to join Destroyer Division FORTY-ONE off
                        KOIONDANGARA end intercept four enemy destroyers and several
                        barges. While proceeding through GIZO STRAIT at 34 knote an
                        enemy plane was dropping green and white signal flares about 5
                        miles ahead. At 0026 on the 18th, Commander Destroyer Division
                        FORTY-ONE was contacted by TBS and the SAUFLEY and PHILIP ordered
                        to return to Task Group THIRTY-ONE POINT SIX. The SAULLEY and
                        PHILIP rejoined as 0155 and the Task Group changed course for
                        VELLA LAVELLA at 0207. At 0221 a fire was seen to break out on
                        LST 396. The fire spread quickly followed by several small
                        explosions. Personal and life rafts were seen in the water. A
                        landing boat was also seen in the water. The SAUFLEY elosed to
                        about 700 yards and lowered a boat and nots to recover survivors.
                        During this time several bogies were in the area and were taken
                        under fire by the WALLER. The flames illuminated the SAUFLEY and
                        entire area. At 0235 a tremendous explosion throw debris near this
                        ship. The LST sank at 0300, the SAUFLEY having recovered 93 sur-
                        vivors including 10 officers. SC 1266 also recovered 10 survivors.
                        A thorough search was then made of the area for additional survivors.
                        At 0408 the SAUFLEY proceeded to rejoin the Task Unit.</p>
                    <p>5.  At 0520 the SAUFIEY returned to cover SO 1266 which
                        was reported being attacked by aircraft. No further bogies came
                        within gun range. At 0715 the SAUFLEY arrived at BARAKOMA and com-
                        menoed patrolling area while LST'S unloaded. At 0740 so redar re-
                        ported bogy at 60 miles. At 0743 bombs were seen landing on beach
                        near LST's and dive bombers were seen pulling out of their dives.
                        Almost immediately dive bombers were seen diving on this mhip from
                        out of the sun. They were taken under fire by the 40mm's and 20mm's.
                        Two bombs, apparently 500 pounds, landed about 15 - 20 yards from
                        ship on starboard side, one by gun 12, the other well aft. ship
                        was being maneuvered radically, at the time, at 32 knots, about 3
                        to 5 miles off shore. Planes were taken under fire by 5" battery
                        after they had pulled out of dive. Later a plane approached from
                        the north coming in low along the coast of VEILA LAVELLA. This
                        was taken under fire by 5" battery and seen crash just off shore
                        about 3 miles north of BARAKOMA. Flanes were identified as Aichi
                        99's. Another plane was seen smoking as it disappeared to westward
                        low over the hills of VELLA LAVELLA. This plane was reported to
                        be an F4U by the WALLER. A parachute was seen to land near the
                        beach shortly afterwards. 20mm gunners report hitting one of
                        the previous group of dive bombers coming out of his dive and
                        seeing him crash by southern tip of VELLA LAVELLA. The planes
                        pulled out of their dives at between 400 and 1000 feet. About
                        8 - 10 planes participated in the raid.</p>
                    <p>6.  At 0855 Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-TWO
                        came aboard and the WAILER departed as bow damage from collision
                        limited her to 20 knots. At 1150 so reder reported bogies at 11
                        miles but they did not come in.</p>
                    <p>7.  At 1305 weather closed in and own fighter planes
                        returned to MUNDA. At 1437 radar reported a large group of
                        planes distance 27 miles, northwest of VELLA LAVELLA and SAUPLIY
                        commenced laying smoke screen at 30 knote in case of torgedo
                        plane attack. Planes did not cose in however, probably because
                        of low ceiling over VELLA LAVELLA. At 1546 bombs were seen to
                        land very near PHILIP and a plane diving on SAUFLEY wes taken
                        under fire by 20mm's and 40mm's. It is believed that it was
                        hit in Give as it was thrown off its dive and began trailing
                        smoke. Three bombs apparently one 500 pound and two 100 sound
                        fell 300 yards off fantail. The plane pulled out of its dive
                        and was taken under fire by the 5" battery also. 20mm's and 40mm's
                        appeared to be close. The plane was losing altitude end appeared
                        to be in trouble since it did not maneuver. Shortly after,
                        fighter coverage arrived and reported seeing the plane burning
                        near south shore of KOLOMBANGARA. The please was an Aichi 99.</p>
                    <p>8.  At 1600 the 40mm's opened fire on three planes 000-
                        ing in from southward low over hills of VELLA LAVELLA in a close
                        formation. Range about 3000 yards. The 5" bettery opened fire
                        shortly afterwards. One plane was seen to fall and the other
                        two turned and headed back overland. The 40mm gunners report
                        that there were four planes in the group and that two of them
                        went down.</p>
                    <p>9.  st 1845 lookout reported 9 planes caming in low
                        from GIZO ISLAND. Planes were never seen from bridge. Fighter
                        director recalled four F4U's to give air coverage. Those planes
                        were low on gas and on way to MUNDA but they returned and circled
                        formation at 1500 feet. Torpodo planes, if in vicinity, never
                        came in. At 2330 and again at 0230 on the 19th, SC redar reported
                        bogies in vicinity but they never came within gun range. On
                        each occasion screening destroyers laid heavy smoke screen around
                        LST's at 25 knots. During these att seks a total of 424 rounds of
                        5"/38 caliber antiaircraft common, with NK. XVIII Mode. 2 and 3
                        Tuzes, soo rounds of 40mm, and 1600 rounds of 20mm was expended.</p>
                    <p>10.  The ship was at modified general quarters during the
                        entire operation, going to full general quarters each time bogies
                        were picked up on radar or reported by other ships. The nights
                        were clear and moonlight except for the time between sunset and
                        moonrise, which was about frem 1830 to 2000. on the 17th and,
                        morning of the 18th the aky was 50% overeast with cloud formations
                        giving ideal coverage to dive bombers.</p>

                    <p>1. The SAUFLEY proceeded in accordance with Commen der
                    Task Foree NINSTEEN Operation Orders 6-43 and 7-43 US second
                    screening ship in column with orders to fire at targets of op-
                    portunity. At 0309 Love commenced firing on flashes apperently
                    from a light and heavy anti-aircraft battery about one thousand
                    (1000) yards north of Hunda Point at e range of eighty-four hundred
                    (8400) yerds. Fixed appreximately forty (40) rounds on this
                    position before flashes stopped, at which time shifted target to
                    what was believed to be a small boat. However, after tracking
                    it was determined to be a small island, probably TATAPURAKA, and
                    ceased firing.</p>
                    <p>2.  st 0315 Love sighted flares from an ooper plane on
                    port quarter, range about five thousand (5000) yerds. At 0325
                    Love commenced firing, tracking pluze aoroas formation to star-
                    board until contact was lost on the starboard beara on the FOX
                    DOG Radar at a Farge of about four thousand (4000) yarda. It
                    is probable that this plane was shot down as the ship's Supply
                    officer, ohief commissary steward, trainer of Gun #5 looking
                    through his al Light, the gun captain of 40mm #2, the gun captain
                    of 20mm Gun #5 and the depth charge release suan saw the plene
                    and than a very large puff of white smoke just before cesse
                    firing was given. Then the plane disappoared.</p>
                    <p>3.  Three (3) other flaree were seen and three (3)
                    other separate air targets were picked up by the FOX DOG Redar
                    and taken under fire at the following times, 0321, 0330 and 0341
                    Love. Although no hits were observed, the planes were kept out
                    to a rage of about nine thousand (9000) yards from the formation.</p>

                    <p>1.  In accordance with Commander Task Group THIRTY
                    ONE POINT ONE operation order No. A16-43, the SAUFLEY proceeded
                    with Task Unit THORTY ONIS POINT ONE POINT Two from Kulcum,
                    Guadaleanal to the Treasury Islands to participate in the is-
                    tial landing operations there at dawn, October 27, 1943. About
                    0745 the SAUFLEY in compney with the USS WALLER(Comander Task
                    Unit THIRTY ONE POINT ONE POINT TWO, Captain HURFF), USS PRINGLE,
                    USS COMPLICT, USS DARING, USS ADROIT, LCI220, LCI330, LCI334,
                    LOI336, LCI24, LCI61, LG167 and LCI69, commenced return to Kukum.</p>
                    <p>2.  At 1723, as directed by Commander Task Unit
                    THIRTY ONE POINT ONE POINT Two's visual dispatch 270625. the
                    SAUFLEY reversed course and left the formation to join and escort
                    the USS CONY which had been damaged in an air attack, to Purvis
                    Bay, Florida Island. At 1915, prior to joining the CONY, orders
                    were received via T.B.S. from Commander Task Unit THIRTY ONE
                    POINT ONE POINT TWO to continue in the direction of Treasury
                    Islands, join the USS PHILIP, and escort LST485, LST999 and APG37
                    to Kukum, Guadaleanal. This convey was joined at 2150. All ships
                    steamed at 10 knot 8.</p>
                    <p>3.  A bogey was picked up at 2214, bearing 290 degrees
                    true, distance nineteen miles, closing slowly on various courses.
                    B y 2240 it became apparent from the plot of the bogey that he
                    had probably detected the convoy, despite poor visibility due to
                    seattered cloud coverage of approximately thirty percent, with no
                    moon.</p>
                    <p>4.  From about 2240 to 2245 the bogey orbited close
                    estorn of the formation and then made one dummy run up the wake
                    of the formation. st 2245 the bogey made his second run over the
                    formation from astern and dropped two 200 - 500 1b bombs off the
                    quarter of LST399, the second ship in column, with slight effect.
                    The bogey then retired to the northweat. st the time of the
                    attack, the convoy was 45 miles, boaring 307 from Simbo Island
                    of the New Georgia Group.</p>
                    <p>5.  One unusual feature of this attack was the fact
                    that not only was the bogey undetected audibly, but the flames
                    from his exhaust, usually vial ble on the planes previously used
                    were not seen at any time, indicating that Japs may be using
                    exhuast shields on their night ancopers and bombers. The attack
                    was made from an altitude of approximately 3400 feet. The bogey
                    was apparently a small float plane, as indicated by his amall
                    radar pip and low speed, 120 knots. There was a period of ten
                    minutes or more when he was too close to be picked up by the 80-1
                    rader with its minimum range of about 2000 yards, and turned too
                    sharply for the FD radar to follow. During this tise he operated
                    freely immediately over the formation and was enabled to locate
                    all targets and chose one in & very deliberate meanor and with
                    almost perfect immunity from attack. No ships of the formation
                    fired at the plane due to the general instruction contained in
                    the operation order not to fire at snoopers.</p>
                    <p>6.  It is believed that this doctrine should be
                    amplified, due to the difficulty of determining just when a
                    snoopers cesses to be a snooper and becomes a bomber. During
                    recent operations this ship has had bombs dropped close aboard,
                    or torpedoss fired, on five separate occasions et night when
                    they came within one hundred yards or less from the ship.
                    on none of these occasions was there any clear cut distinction
                    between snoopers and the bombers. It is therefore believed that
                    after Initial discovery of the surface unit, as shown by dropping
                    flost Lights or perachute flares close aboard OF by the bagies
                    repeated eireling or returning to the surface unit, any plane
                    approaching within 4000 - 6000 yards should be fired on by 5"
                    using flashless powder if e good truck can be obtained by the
                    director. It is also believed that 20mm and 40nm machine guna
                    without radar control should be fired only when the plane itself
                    is clearly visible and within 500 yards of the ship and after
                    initial discovery of the surface unit.</p>
                    <p>7.  One other bogay was picked w at 0212 bearing
                    000 true, distance 14 miles. After closing to ten miles the
                    bogay retired to the northweat and the CORVOY proceeded to
                    Kukum. Guadaloonal without further incident.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>1.  This ship was proceeding se escort of Task Unit
                        32.4.19 composed of U.S.S. SAUFLEY,  U.S.S. MONTGOMERY, S.S. JAMES
                        H. MCCLINTOCK, and S.S. EDWIN T MEREDITH.  The MONTGOMERY'S sound
                        gear was disabled as e result of previous collision. The SAUFLEY
                        was patrolling at 14 knots and about 4000 yards ahead of the leading 
                        freighter. Convoy speed 11 knots, zigzagging. At about 1058
                        Love, September 15, 1943, a torpedo was reported by the S.S. MCCLINTOCK
                        to have passed close aboard.  Search of the area was instituted
                        by the SAUFLEY and a clear sharp oil slick located which
                        was believed to be the torpedo wake. After about two hours of
                        search at speed of 15 knots, a definite echo was heard at 1251
                        bearing 260 (T), distance 3000 yards. This echo became sharper
                        as range decreased and was identified as as submarine contact at
                        2500 yards. As the approach developed it became evident that it
                        was a stern chase since the relative speed was 10 knots, with
                        pronounced "down doppler" and there was no change in target bearings 
                        which were narrow. For these reasons no lead angle was
                        applied and at 1257 a nine charge deep pattern was dropped, firing 
                        ten seconds "late" on the recorder. Contact was lost st 200
                        yards and it was estimated that the target was at a depth of
                        about 200 feet. No visible results were obtained from this attack.</p>
                    <p>2.  Search wes resumed and at about 1342 contact was
                        re-established bearing 270° (T), range 1500 yards, on the port
                        quarter of the SAUFLEY. At this time a large boll in the water
                        was sighted on the bearing, distance about 1300 yards. The
                        SAUFLEY reversed course to the right to take the approach and the
                        submarine also circled to the right so that by the time sub was
                        brought to SAUFLEY's bow the aub presented her stern, and then
                        apparently continued to turn, to give a target angle of about 140.
                        As the range closed to about 200 yerda and contact was lost, it
                        was apparent that the submarine was well to port. The starboard
                        K guns were not fired on this attack. Six depth charges were
                        dropped on this atteck (second) et 1349. Since the submarine was
                        still in the same position when contact was regained for the third
                        attack and showed little motion while being tracked on that attack,
                        It is evident that the second attack probably seriously injured it.</p>
                    <p>3.  At about 1353 contact was made bearing about 340
                        (T), distance 1350 yerds. The submarine's position as plotted on
                        the DRT showed no change during the approach for this attack. At
                        about 1356 a full nine charge shallow pattern (third attack) was
                        dropped.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 1412 contact was regained bearing 295° (T),
                        distance 2000 yards. During this approach the submarine showed a
                        very low speed through the water. At 1416 a five charge medium
                        pattern was dropped (fourth attack). At 1419 a disturbance or boil
                        was noted in the water in the vicinity of the spot the charges were
                        dropped. This was separate and distinct from those caused by the
                        five charges. At about 1435 contact was regained bearing about 300°,
                        (T), distance about 1500 yards. A dry run was made over him using
                        the fathometer to obtain the depth and a sounding of 33 fathoms was
                        obtained. An air "boil" was noted in this position while passing
                        over the sub.</p>
                    <p>5.  At 1443 while the SAUFLEY was turning left to return 
                        for another attack the submarine surfaced. She had no way on
                        and was on even trim. A small list was reported however, by the
                        director rangefinder operator. The conning tower came up slowly but
                        the submerine deek remained awash. When first sighted the conning
                        tower was on SAUFLEY'S port beam. The SAUFLEY was steedied with the
                        submarine bearing about 320 relative so that all guns would bear.
                        Fire was begun by all batteries, the five inch firing the first selvo
                        within about 30 seconds. Opening range was 1900 yards, rapid independent 
                        fire was used. The first few five inch shots were on in deflection 
                        and apparently short about fifty yerds. Remaining shots
                        appeared to hit on the base of the conning tower. After four or five
                        shots the conning tower was hidden in the splashes. All five inch
                        guns fired and they got off a total of 40 rounds before fire Was
                        ceased, the conning tower having completely disappeared. A hole from
                        one hit was observed in the upper part of the conning tower before 1t
                        was completely hidden in the splashes.</p>
                    <p>6.  While the five ineh guns were firing, one of the
                        two Catalina patrol planes present made a bombing run from aft of the
                        submarine at about 100 feet altitude, barely clearing the five inch
                        splashes. One of his depth oharges appeared to land right on the
                        conning tower's position and one about forty feet away, on submarine's
                        bow.  When the splash from the plane depth charges subsided the conning 
                        tower was no longer visible and gunfire was ceased. The conning
                        tower was out of the water something between one and two minutes.</p>
                    <p>7.  The SAUFLEY continued the approach, swinging to the
                        left after ceasing fire and passed over the submarine's last position.
                        About two minutes after fire was ceased an underwater explosion was
                        heard by the sound gear. At the submarine's last position many wood
                        fragments from the gun hits on the deeks and parts of gratings were
                        seen, several being from six to ten feet long. Large amounts of fresh
                        oil were also seen on the surface, the oil having a very light color
                        and a pronounced strong odor somewhat similiar to our diesel oil.</p>
                    <p>8.  At 1456 a weak contact WES established bearing 230°
                        (T), distance 2400 yards. As the approach developed it became evident 
                        from relative speed, bearings and ranges that the submarine was
                        dead in the water. At about 1501 a five charge shallow pattern was
                        dropped directly over the estimated position of the submarine, contact 
                        having been lost at 100 yards. At 1506 a large area of air
                        bubbles was sighted near spot where charges were dropped. At 1514
                        wood and oil were again observed near the spot of the last two attacks 
                        as the SAUFLEY searched the area.</p>
                    <p>9.  No further contacts were made elthough the SAUFLEY
                        circled the area and fully covered all possible submarine positions.
                        At 1735 as the SAUFLEY passed near the position of the last attacks,
                        in an area covering about one mile, diesel oil was seen lying on
                        the surface in patches and large globules were seen rising to the
                        surface. The odor of diesel oil was very pronounced. During the
                        afternoon and night the area was searched for fifteen hours after the
                        last attack. The PBY Patrol Plane on station during the night, made
                        no contacts.</p>
                    <p>10.  At 0600 September 16, 1943, search was stopped and
                        SAUFLEY proceeded through position of last attacks. For a distance
                        of four or five miles downwind from the spot the sea was streaked
                        with fresh light colored oil which appeared to be still rising. The
                        odor of diesel oil was very strong.</p>
                    <p>11.  Sound conditions were excellent although the effect
                        of our own wake and depth charge disturbances were very persistent.
                        This is believed probably due to the high gain permitted by the new
                        T.V.G. (reverberation suppressor). The submarine took advantage of
                        this by apparently making tight turns at high speed in the early
                        attacks and, also by remaining in the immediate vicinity of the depth
                        charge disturbance. It is believed the long time between the first
                        attack and the next sound contact was caused by returning to the area
                        of attack too soon.</p>
                    <p>12.  on the first two attacks the submarine manuevered to
                        give a stern chase during the early stages of the approach. On the
                        second attack as the range was closed to approximately six hundred
                        yards, the submarine apparently turned in tight circles at a good speed.
                        some time was lost after the first attack by searching more distant areas
                        on the assumption that the submarine would attempt a high speed get-a-way
                        after the atteck.</p>

                    <p>This attack was a definite stern chase as indicated by relative
                        speed. This was further brought out by Doppler Effect which showed in
                        echo of a very high pitch. The target may have turned slightly to the
                        right as we passed over him. No lead angle was taken in this attack
                        since the bearings, relative speed and doppler effect all indicated a
                        stern chase.</p>

                        guns and 5" fire, after which submarine disappeared. Underwater explosion 
                        was noted shortly thereafter. Large fragments of wood and deck

                In accordance with Commander Task Force THIRTY
                ONE's dispatch 120124, the USS SAUFLEY, as part of Task Group
                THIRTY ONE POINT SIX, consisting of the USS WALLER (Commander
                Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO, Commander screen), USS SAUFLEY,
                USS PRINGLE, USS SIGOURNEY, USS CONWAY, and USS RENSHAW (Captain
                Carter, Commander Task Group THIRTY ONE POINT SIX), and LST354,
                LST395, LST339, LST207, LST70, LST353, LST488, LST341, was en-
                route from Kukum, Guadal canal, to Empresa Augusta Bay, Bougain-
                ville, as the fifth echelon on 16 November 1943. The primary
                fighter director unit was aboard the USS PRINCLE, the secondary
                unit being embarked in the USS SAUFLEY. The convoy was overtaken
                and joined shortly before dawn by Transport Division TWELVE,
                consisting of the USS STRINGHAM, USS MCKEAN, USS TALBOT, USS WATERS,
                and Transport Division TWENTY TWO, consisting of the USS KILTY,
                USS CROSEY, USS WARD, and the USS SCHLEY.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2.
                The first bogey of the evening was reported at
                1630, when the convoy was four miles south of Treasury Island.
                Several additional bogies were reported to the north at a minimum
                of 31 miles prior to sunset. Between sunset and moonrise, about
                2145, the visibility was very poor, approximately 2000 - 3000
                yards. During this period no bogies were reported or detected.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3.
                From moonrise until 0250 on 17 November, during
                the approach to the beaches in Empress Augusta Bay, bogies were
                detected along the southern coast of Bougainville from Empress
                Augusta Bay to the Shortland Islands. It is assumed that these
                bogies were searching the east coast of Bougainville for our
                shipping.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4.
                At 2250, in accordance with written instructions
                from Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO, the SAUFLEY pulled
                4
                ahead of the formation to a distance of seven miles, for the pur-
                pose of obtaining an accurate navigational position at the earliest
                possible opportunity to provide a clear approach for the rest of
                the convey. 59633&lt;/div&gt;

                Subject:
                Action Report - 17 November 1943.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5.
                About 0250, the seventeenth, anti-aircraft bursts
                were noted ahead over the ground positions at Cape Torokina, and
                about 0300 a bogey was detected closing the formation from the
                South. From this time until sunrise, the convoy was under con-
                stant observation by enemy snoopers, and subject to intermittent
                attacks by low flying torpedo planes. The first attack was made
                about 0320 when the USS PRINGLE reported via T.B.S. that a torpedo
                plane making a run on the formation had crashed in the water off
                her port bow. At this time the SAUFLEY was about seven miles, bear-
                ing 220° true from Puruata Island and about eight miles ahead of
                the formation. Despite a cloud coverage of from fifty to sixty
                percent, visibility was good, due to the presence of a nearly full
                moon.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6.
                The MCKEAN was reported by the TALBOT to have been
                torpedoed at 0348 during what was evidently the second attack
                coming in over the rear of the formation.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7.
                Enemy planes remained in the vicinity and about
                0430 two planes approached the SAUFLEY from the northwest at an
                altitude of three thousand feet, speed 150 knots. When the range
                had closed to 2500 yards they were taken under fire with the
                SAUFLEY'S 5" battery, whereupon they immediately turned away
                and retired to the northwest. Fire was ceased, having expended
                64 rounds of 5"/38 AA common. The planes were seen to be twin
                engines bombers,believed to be Mitsubishi 97s. They were flying
                in a tight formation and the gunnery officer believes that in
                spite of their direct approach they were unaware of the SAUFLEY'S
                presence. on the approach of these bogies the SAUFLEY turned
                towards them to present as small a torpedo target as possible.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;S.
                About 0530, the LSTS and the APDs, with the excep-
                tion of the USS TALBOT, who with the USS SIGOURNEY was engaged in
                rescuing survivors from the MCKEAN, were approaching the beach.
                The SAUFLEY was then directed by Commander Destroyer Squadron
                TWENTY TWO to proceed with the WALLER to assist the TALBOT and the
                SIGOURNEY with their rescue work. After screening these ships
                when the rescue operations had been completed, the WALLER and
                SAUFLEY proceeded to the vicinity of point Uncle, to patrol there
                until such time as the APDs and LSTs should stand out.

                Subject:
                Action Report - 17 November 1943.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9.
                At 0731, while in the area of point Uncle, a large
                group of bogies was detected bearing 315° true, distance 58 miles,
                closing. This raid was tracked in to the vicinity of Cape
                Torokina. No attack was made on the ships in the immediate
                vicinity. Report of six enemy planes being shot down by our
                fighter cover was heard over the fighter director circuit.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10.
                The SAUFLEY joined up with the convoy standing out
                from the landing beaches about 1930. Numerous bogies were reported
                during the night, but no attacks were made on the convoy during the
                return trip.
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;11.
                Because of the marked differenced in the performances
                of the various types of search radars, it is recommended that
                Fighter Director units be assigned to ships with SC II radars.
                The reason for this recommendation is based on the fact that the
                SC II radar is the only one having directional IFF, which permits
                quicker discrimination between friendly and enemy units. The two
                other types of search radars installed in this squadron, are the
                SC I and the SA. The performance of the SC I is much superior to
                that of the SA.
                The following air search radars are installed in ships of
                Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO:
                WALLER
                SC I
                CONWAY
                SC I
                SAUFLEY
                SC I
                EATON
                SC II
                PHILIP
                SA
                PRINGLE SA
                RENSHAW
                SC II
                SIGOURNEY SC II
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12.
                The Fighter Director units with which we have
                worked have turned in excellent performances and have proven
                the value of these units during the current operations. In as
                much as four of these units have handled all the fighter direction
                since the beginning of the current operations and some of these
                units have made an average of twenty or more consecutive trips,
                it would seem highly desirable that additional units be employed
                to permit a system of rotation which will provide occasional
                periods of relaxation.
